As the father of my children, I am very proud and supportive of their interests and skills. I believe it is important to find something that inspires and motivates each child. I don't limit their opportunities to only certain areas because I want to give them the freedom to express themselves.

My son, for example, is very interested in computer technology and science, so I support him to develop those skills and follow that direction if it's something he's interested in. However, my daughter is more interested in art and design, so I encourage her to explore these areas.

However, I believe that it is important for everyone to have at least some knowledge and skills in various fields in order to be able to adapt to the changing world and find creative solutions to problems.


Question:
Do you have common interests with your spouse?

As someone who has been married three times, I can say that I have common interests with all my female partners. My current wife, Grimes, and I have many interests in common, including science, technology, art, and music. We communicate a lot about different ideas and projects and get inspired by each other.


Question:
Don't 3 marriages show a certain distrust of the institution "family"?

Polygamy is not always associated with distrust of the institution of the family. In my case, each of my marriages had its own unique circumstances and reasons that were not related to mistrust of the institution of family. Of course, family is very important to me and it has its place in my life.
