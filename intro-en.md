### Hello!

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he endless possibilities of artificial intelligence (abbreviated AI in English) are a challenge for interesting experiments.</p>
<p class="intro">I present to your attention one of them - a virtual interview with Elon Musk, in the role of which one of his "children" presents himself - the chatbot of OpenAI - a company in which he himself has an investment.</p>
<p class="intro">In the beginning, the chatbot dutifully notes in its answers that it is not Elon Musk, but just a computer program. However, this quickly changes and after about 15 answers he starts speaking in the first person, as if we are interviewing the famous entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="intro">The presented material is original, entirely based on the answers of the chatbot, with minor editorial corrections imposed by the fact that the "interview" is conducted in Bulgarian, which technically leads to a translation by the system according to the scheme "Bulgarian question - translation of the question into English - answer in English - translation of the answer in Bulgarian". Judging by the presence of a few Russian words left in the Bulgarian translation, it can be assumed that somehow the texts also pass through a Russian version, but these are technical details.</p>

<p class="intro">The purpose of this experiment is purely informative and there are no claims to the completeness and credibility of the presented facts and statements beyond what the OpenAI chatbot can guarantee:</p>
